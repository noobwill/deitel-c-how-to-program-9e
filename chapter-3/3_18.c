/*
* (Sales-Commission Calculator)
* One large chemical company pays its salespeople on a commission basis.
* The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week.
* For example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of chemicals in a week receives $200 plus 9% of $5000, or a total of $650.
* Develop a program that will use scanf to input each salesperson’s gross sales for last week and calculate and display that salesperson’s earnings.
* Process one salesperson's figures at a time.
* Here is a sample input/output dialog:
* Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 5000.00
  Salary is: $650.00

  Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 1234.56
  Salary is: $311.11
  
  Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): -1
