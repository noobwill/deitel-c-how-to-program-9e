/*
* (How Fast Is Your Computer?)
* How can you determine how fast your own computer operates? 
* Write a program with a while loop that counts from 1 to 1,000,000,000, incrementing by 1 during each iteration of the loop.
* Every time the count reaches a multiple of 100,000,000, print that number on the screen.
* Use your watch to time how long each 100 million iterations of the loop takes.
* Hint: Use the remainder operator to recognize each time the counter reaches a multiple of 100,000,000.
