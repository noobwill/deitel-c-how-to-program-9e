/*
* (Salary Calculator)
* Develop a program that will determine the gross pay for each of several employees.
* The company pays “straight time” for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and pays “time-and-a-half” for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours.
* You’re given a list of the company’s employees, the number of hours each worked last week and each employee’s hourly rate.
* Your program should use scanf to input this information for each employee and determine and display the employee’s gross pay.
* Here is a sample input/output dialog:
* Enter # of hours worked (-1 to end): 39
  Enter hourly rate of the worker ($00.00): 10.00
  Salary is $390.00

  Enter # of hours worked (-1 to end): 40
  Enter hourly rate of the worker ($00.00): 10.00
  Salary is $400.00

  Enter # of hours worked (-1 to end): 41
  Enter hourly rate of the worker ($00.00): 10.00
  Salary is $415.00

  Enter # of hours worked (-1 to end): -1
