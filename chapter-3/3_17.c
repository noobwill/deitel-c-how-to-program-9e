/*
* (Credit-Limit Calculator)
* 
* Develop a C program that will determine whether a department-store customer has exceeded the credit limit on a charge account.
* For each customer, the following facts are available:
* (a) Account number
* (b) Balance at the beginning of the month
* (c) Total of all items charged by this customer this month
* (d) Total of all credits applied to this customer's account this month
* (e) Allowed credit limit
*
* The program should use scanf to input each fact, calculate the new balance (= beginning balance + charges – credits), and determine whether the new balance exceeds the customer's credit limit. 
* 
* For those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the program should display the customer's account number, credit limit, new balance and the message “Credit limit exceeded.”
* 
* Here is a sample input/output dialog:
* Enter account number (-1 to end): 100
  Enter beginning balance: 5394.78
  Enter total charges: 1000.00
  Enter total credits: 500.00
  Enter credit limit: 5500.00
  Account:      100
  Credit limit: 5500.00
  Balance:      5894.78
  Credit Limit Exceeded.

  Enter account number (-1 to end): 200
  Enter beginning balance: 1000.00
  Enter total charges: 123.45
  Enter total credits: 321.00
  Enter credit limit: 1500.00
  
  Enter account number (-1 to end): 300
  Enter beginning balance: 500.00
  Enter total charges: 274.73
  Enter total credits: 100.00
  Enter credit limit: 800.00

  Enter account number (-1 to end): -1
